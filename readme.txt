As of now, the INPI has digitized all their procedures and makes their
industrial property data, including trademark data, available for reuse.
This data is accessible free of charge on an FTP server in formats
such as XML for notices, with related images and multimedia files
provided in various other formats. While the INPI is also working
on developing an API to display data relating to French trademarks
at 'data.inpi.fr', it's not currently available for third-party software
to register or renew trademarks​.


For now, you can access their trademark data directly from their FTP server,
as described above. This method would involve downloading
the datafiles you need and processing them locally,
rather than scraping data from a website.
This could be advantageous as it provides structured data in a ready-to-use format.

For further details, you can visit the INPI's official website at www.inpi.fr,
which could also provide additional resources and information
on accessing their trademark data​ (EPO)​.
